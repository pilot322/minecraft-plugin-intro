# Introduction to Java Programming with server plugins!

This project is dedicated to all the people that want to start learning Java because of Minecraft, so they can get to work while still playing the game.

## "Plugin development is hard"

That's what they tell you before watching any tutorial on making plugins for Minecraft.

They tell you to return to the tutorial once you learn a bit of Java.

This project aims to **give you an interface in which you can practice your Java skills, in Minecraft!**

Instructions coming soon.
